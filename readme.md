### montecarlo spheres

An experiment with some java libraries for task parallel computing: jomp, pyjama, jcuda

Applying a simple montecarlo algorithm, this tool computes resulting volume on a set of spheres (hence the name) in various position (intersecting, tangenting, concentric) and then visualize a 3D cartesian plot

Different time results are achieved applying jomp, pyjama or jcuda - and native java executor framework.

Run it, and enjoy yourself ;D
